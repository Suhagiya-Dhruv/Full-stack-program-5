# Introduction to HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language). HTML is the standard language for creating web pages and web applications. It provides the structure of a webpage, allowing you to organize and display content such as text, images, and links.

## Basic Structure of an HTML Document

An HTML document is made up of various elements that define the structure and content of the webpage. Here's a simple example:

## Explanation of HTML Elements

### Headings

Headings are used to create titles and subtitles on your webpage. There are six levels of headings, from `<h1>` to `<h6>`, with `<h1>` being the highest (or most important) level and `<h6>` the lowest.

```html
<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>
<h6>Heading 6</h6>
```

### Block Elements

Block elements occupy the full width available and start on a new line. Common block elements include `<div>` and `<p>`.

```html
<div>Hello</div>
<div>Lorem ipsum dolor sit, amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Aspernatur, eos.</div>
<div>Hello 2</div>

<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit, amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Aspernatur, eos.</p>
<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit, amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Aspernatur, eos.</p>
```

### Self-Closing Tags

Some HTML elements do not have any content and are self-closing. A common example is the line break `<br />`.

```html
<br />
```

### Inline Elements

Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. Common inline elements include `<span>`.

```html
<span>Hello</span>
<span>Hello 2</span>
```
